Of course\! As a Streamlit and data science expert, I can certainly create a sleek, futuristic portfolio web app for you.

This code will generate a multi-tab Streamlit application based on the information in your resume. It features a rule-based chatbot, an interactive experience timeline, a section for your projects and links, and a resume download function.

-----

### **Instructions to Run Your Portfolio App**

1.  **Save the Code:** Save the Python code below into a file named `app.py`.
2.  **Create a `requirements.txt` file:** In the same folder, create this file and add the single line: `streamlit`.
3.  **Place Your Resume:** Download your resume and save it as `resume.pdf` in the *same folder* as `app.py`.
4.  **Install Libraries:** Open your terminal or command prompt in that folder and run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5.  **Run the App:** In the same terminal, run the command: `streamlit run app.py`. Your new portfolio will open in your web browser\!
